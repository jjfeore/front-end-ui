# Pinterest Registration Page - Stretch UI
*20 MAR 2017*
This page is a quick stretch lab assignment for Code Fellows. This is my attempt to recreate the Pinterest registration page in 75 minutes or less. The goal is to mockup a rough approximation of the registration page, without any of the necessary functionality. In so far as possible, I will aim to make this page and future stretch UI pages responsive.
